          <p>I&rsquo;m fascinated every time I discover an ecosystem of apps and tools that is similar with what I&rsquo;m trying to build here, with Trinkets.<br />
            I feel excited like I&rsquo;ve encountered an ancient civilization from another dimension, hidden for 1 million years.</p>
          <p>It took me a week to study most of the interesting repositories when I could find some spare time.<br />
            At first I was totally overwhelmed by the number of weird names (eg: Arvelie, Heol, Indental, Tablatal, Neralie, Oscean, Horaire) and I thought &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s in Finnish, or maybe Volapük&rdquo;. Now I think it&rsquo;s in <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/lietal">Lietal</a> - an experimental synthetic language - I might be wrong.<br />
            I also thought it&rsquo;s related to <a href="https://urbit.org/">Urbit</a>, because of the names, but they&rsquo;re actually not related.</p>
          <p>All the tools below are documented on <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com">wiki.XXIIVV.com</a>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/nataniev">Nataniev</a> is a collection of free and open-source software following a singular design philosophy, and aesthetic</li>
            <li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/oscean">Oscean</a> is a fully static publishing platform created to work in the P2P space</li>
            <li><a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/horaire">Horaire</a> is a time-tracking tool</li>
            <li><a href="https://100r.co/pages/about.html">Hundred Rabbits</a> interesting tools, games, blog posts and knowledge sharing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Everything was designed to be simple, without external libraries, easy to debug and repair.<br />
            Also, I believe they were built because the creators are digital nomads that have intermitent access to internet; they were created in isolation and must work offline.
            Which is absolutely amazing!</p>
          <p>There are other ecosystems that I was also made me enthusiastic in the past, a few come to mind:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/ipfs/">IPFS</a> and the whole system around it;</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/urbit/">Urbit</a> decentralized operating system;</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/choojs/">Choo.js</a> small browser tools written in Javascript;</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore">hyperCore</a> and the whole stack build on top of that: hypertrie, hyperdb, hyperdrive, etc.</li>
            <li><a href="https://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage</a> and &ldquo;storage on the Web&rdquo; ecosystem.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&hellip; But XXIIVV is a little closer to what I&rsquo;m building.</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why it&rsquo;s so fascinating, but I have a few ideas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>it&rsquo;s an incredibly diverse set of utilities (tools for date and time, for storing and parsing data, a flow-based event emitter, tools for blogs, for decentralized chat; a text editor, drawing tools, music composition, a programming language and mobile games!)</li>
            <li>the code is usually very simple (the <a href="https://github.com/XXIIVV/Oscean/blob/master/scripts/lib/neralie.js">Neralie code</a> is only 15 lines)</li>
            <li>I love the community that was build around it</li>
            <li>almost everything is free, open source and with a permissive software license</li>
            <li>I feel inspired and motivated and I&rsquo;m thinking of ways to contribute, and intersect some my work with that ecosystem</li>
            <li>all the projects seem so familiar that I think if my life would have turned a different way 10 years ago, I might have reached similar conclusions that could have made me build the same kind of tools.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>I&rsquo;m writing this post mostly for myself. But also in the hope that this info might be useful for somebody interested in similar stuff.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>**Extra lessons learned for me:</p>
          <p>If I&rsquo;m publishing any open-source software and the license is permisive, it is assumed I&rsquo;m publishing it for other people to use.
            So if I care about the users, it&rsquo;s my duty to try and explain to the best of my abilities what that piece of software is doing.<br />
            It&rsquo;s not an easy task, but I have to do the work, if I want the users to have a smooth experience.</p>
          <p>This doesn&rsquo;t apply if the software is private, or the license is very restrictive, because no-one else will ever use it anyway.</p>
          <p>So how can I know what to add in the README of the software?</p>
          <p>The first thing that comes into mind is to answer &ldquo;<strong>The 5 W</strong>&ldquo;: who, what, where, when, why.<br />
            Not all of them will be relevant for all the projects, but it&rsquo;s a good starting point&hellip;</p>
          <p>For the &ldquo;What&rdquo; question, I think at least the &ldquo;What problem is this trying to solve?&rdquo; should be answered.<br />
            Also the &ldquo;What other similar software is out there?&rdquo; is pretty useful, for people to position this one in a familiar context.</p>
