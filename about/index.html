          <p>Our applications are created by humans and for humans. They are not created for machines; nor are they created for companies, whether they be in IT or marketing.</p>
          <p>The focus of the applications is neither to empower their creators nor to turn a profit - the focus is for the applications to be really useful and easy to use.</p>
          <p>We believe that the tools should be totally out of our way and because of that, the software we build has special limitations and requirements.</p>
          <p>The first thing is that a piece of software should enable good practices in the user, in such a way that if the software is eliminated, the user can still use the good practices in his daily life and all the data created and used by the software is still usable by the user.</p>
          <p>A user&rsquo;s data are solely their own and they must have absolute control over it. By default, all data are stored on user&rsquo;s devices and can be easily seen by the user in their entirety. The user may decide to store the data somewhere else (e.g. cloud storage). The user knows where that data are located and is free to change their own past data (e.g. they might want to enrich past events, or redact sensitive data).</p>
          <p>The conclusion that comes from the previous ideas is that it&rsquo;s highly preferable to store the data in human-readable text files, than in a binary database, even with the risk of an acceptable performance loss.</p>
          <p>A good compromise can be that the &ldquo;the only source of truth&rdquo; is still the readable text files, but a specialized converter translates the text into an efficient binary structure, from time to time and the application uses the optimized structure.</p>
          <p>Our software must work offline just as normal as online, because we have no central servers that dictate the behaviour of our apps. But we understand that Cloud Services are important for specific use-cases so the user should be able to use them without limitation.</p>
          <p>All the libraries and dependencies we use are carefully selected to be the best quality. And we try to keep them to a minimum.</p>
          <p>We like to call these concepts &ldquo;Ethical software&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t treat your customers like products. Just like ethical eating, that doesn&rsquo;t treat animals like products.</p>
          <p>We understand that this kind of software cannot satisfy everybody, but that&rsquo;s OK. Choice and diversity are important.</p>
          <p>There are other people and applications that respect the same principles and we applaud them.</p>
